"""audit_public.py — the first-push gate and the CI job: no game-derived bytes among the tracked files.
(Installed by decomp-architect, install.py S2, as tools/audit_public.py; a generalisation of the source project's audit.)

    tools/audit_public.py                 # every git-tracked file (git ls-files)
    tools/audit_public.py --paths a b …   # an explicit file list (the planted-fixture control; a pre-commit hook)

Everything it forbids is DERIVED from config/firewall.txt — purge rules and hash sources — never from a typed list:
  1. PURGE PATHS — no tracked file lies under a `purge:` prefix or a `glob:` rule.
  2. CONTENT HASH — no tracked file's SHA1 appears in the hash set built from the `required:` / `fixture:` / resolvable
     `pending:` sources (a `.jsonl` manifest with a `sha1` key per line, or sha1sum-format checksum files, globs allowed).
     A renamed copy is caught by content. Zero-length files are exempt by content (an empty payload shares the empty
     file's hash).
  3. SIZE — no tracked file over the host's warning threshold (50 MiB).
  4. DISASSEMBLY-SHAPED CONTENT — no tracked TEXT file carries a long contiguous run of lines shaped like an assembler
     listing, an objdump, a splitter's address/word comment or a label block: the case a path-and-hash audit cannot
     see — a notes file that pastes a function's instructions is game-derived even when the tracked C reproduces the
     bytes. The criterion is the LONGEST CONTIGUOUS run per file (cap 64 lines), so a short quoted diff passes.
Coverage is asserted: a missing `required:` source, zero resolvable sources, or zero purge rules is a FAILURE, never a
pass; a missing `pending:` source is warned loudly. Every count prints with its denominator; exit 1 names every offender.
Negative control: the installer plants the fixture blob and asserts this audit FAILS on it before trusting a PASS.
CI runs it without the game: it reads only tracked text and hashes tracked files.
